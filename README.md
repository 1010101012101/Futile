#Futile 0.2
###_A Unity 2D engine for the rest of us_

Futile is a super simple 2D engine for Unity. 

This is for those of you who want to do everything in code and want as little editor integration as possible. 
It'll be especially familiar if you come from a background using Cocos2D or Flash.

It's still super rough, under development, and completely undocumented... but it works. 

Futile contains many ideas (as well as the MiniJSON parser) from Prime 31's UIToolkit: [github.com/Prime31/UIToolkit](http://github.com/Prime31/UIToolkit)

The demo project also uses Prime31's fantastic GoKit tweening library: [github.com/Prime31/GoKit](http://github.com/Prime31/GoKit)
